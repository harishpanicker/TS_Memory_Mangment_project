how to run the app:
-------------------

1) creating Dynamic library for that we need .o file (object file)
------------------------------------------------------------------

cc- c -fPIC lib.c --> this will generate a lib.o file

cc -shared -o libmem.so(name of my shared library) lib.o(the generated object file)

(the above command will generate shared library for you .so file)

cc userapp.c ./libmem.so -o test

(test is the name of the executable)

how to check whether my .so file is linked as shared library or not

ldd test (list all dependencies)


2) how to insert driver
-----------------------
sudo su
make
insmod my_driver.ko
dmesg | tail

[NOTE : After running the below step follow this step]
ps -e | test (for finding my pid to know mmap related info)
cat /proc/pid/maps
(you will get dmesgs)


3) now run the application by opening another terminal 
------------------------------------------------------
sudo su
./test [you will get the options you can tryout]

[mmap you will find under ioctl operation(data_tx /data_rx) where i'm transmitting and receiving data via shared memory created using mmap.

4) Remove the driver
--------------------

rmmod my_driver.ko
dmesg | tail
make clean
